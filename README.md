# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

................../// Speciality of This Website////.................
1. welcome to HOtel Sairu. its situated in Sajek. You can easily check in thery. you are cordially invited to this Hotel sorrounded by majestic hills in Sajek & check in to the entising room.
2. There are 2 tasks in Room detail page, which are
a.ðŸ“œðŸ“œ There will be a Book Now. On clicking Book Now the user can book a room.
Make sure the room will be unavailable when someone books the room.

b.ðŸ“œðŸ“œThe system should ensure that users can only book available rooms. Initially, there will be some available seats. On booking the available seats will be decremented.

ðŸ“œðŸ“œ My CommentðŸ“œðŸ“œ
I found these 2 points confusing & little bit contradictiory. i could be wrong. but I implemented the 2nd point. & asked in support session about these, they said it's absolutely okay what I implemented. i need not to worry. 
ðŸ“œ My Logic of this point is on clicking book now the room is booked in database.  & after each booking the "availableSeat" count property decreases 1 by 1. which was the 2nd condition. thats why i have not implemented the first condition of " making room unavailable after 1 booking" 

3. all the  user crentials, along with the room booking credentials, & everythig about our Hotel  is saved on database with strong security through JWT. For that, the no user without token, can access any private details of hotel, & see other users booking info & user info. 

4. the website users can easily book their room with their convenient date, also are free to cancel booking, but booking cancellion must be done one day before the  chosen date. 

5. The website is a react based website , created using most of the React npm packages. for example React date picker, AOS animation, momentjs. Mongodb is used to save the data in database.


5.  Many more functionalitis remaining to add. But these will be added later after submission. Now  kindly give me the chance of getting ACC.
